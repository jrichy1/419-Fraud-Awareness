# 419 Fraud Awareness

## Overview
419 fraud, also known as an advance-fee scam, is a deceptive scheme where victims are tricked into paying upfront fees with the promise of receiving a large financial reward. This repository is dedicated to raising awareness about these scams and providing tools and resources to help people recognize and avoid them.

## What is 419 Fraud?
The term "419" originates from Section 419 of the Nigerian Criminal Code, which deals with fraud. Though these scams are not limited to Nigeria, they are a global issue and operate in many forms, including:
- Fake inheritance claims
- Lottery winnings
- Business investment offers
- Romance scams

Victims are often contacted via email, social media, or phone and are persuaded to pay advance fees for supposed legal documents, taxes, or processing costs. The promised reward never materializes.

## How It Works
1. **Initial Contact**: Scammers send unsolicited messages claiming to offer a financial windfall.
2. **Trust Building**: They establish trust and urgency to manipulate victims.
3. **Advance Fees**: Victims are asked to pay upfront fees or share sensitive information.
4. **Continuous Demands**: Once payment is made, scammers invent new reasons to demand more money.
